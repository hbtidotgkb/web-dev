Enjoy the day with candles on your cake;<br></br>
Sing a song and make the dance floor to quake;<br></br>
<br></br>
Your heart has purity no less than that of a snowflake;<br></br>
Your eyes are a reflection of shining water in a blue lake;<br></br>
<br></br>
You have a smile that's something impossible to fake;<br></br>
You are your best version so never change for other's sake;<br></br>
<br></br>
Knowing you virtually is my life's biggest take;<br></br>
I'm desperately looking forward for our first hand shake;<br></br>
<br></br>
Stay motivated & strong with the decisions that you make;<br></br>
I wish you explore yourself to maximum as there is only one life & no remake;<br></br>
<br></br>
Discussion with Cathy troubles us more than any type of body ache;<br></br>
Sharing your birthdate with her proves that even God can commit mistake;<br></br>
<br></br>
Here I stop myself and apply a disc brake;<br></br>
Your friends may be hungry so blow the candles and cut the cake!<br></br>
<br></br>
Wishing you a very Happy Birthday, Enjoy the day with candles on your cake.
